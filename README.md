Building e-laborate app!
- an approach to building stories as a cohort.

This idea hit me while in the midst of a heated debate about the "proper"
ending to Game of Thrones' episode 4 season 8, where i stated with some ferocity,
I'm gonna write my own damn version of the ending, moment .
This belligerence created an idea for a forum where i could write this story
and where my friends, and potentially other fans who also liked the series but also had their own version
of it's climactic ending, might be able to collaborate on my essay/story/book/blog/novel
to come up with an overall more dynamic story that could have MUCH more amazing ideas
than those limited to the scope of my singular imagination.

the premise is, "like a Github,... for writers!".

So we have collaboration, but do we have recognition?

The collaborative effort that would come from other contributors, yes, and even better
those contributors can be recognized for their genius with a simple hovering over that author's text,
and right clicking the e-text to show who wrote that bit of story. Now, not all stories ideas that get pushed
to the collaborative effort, will be included in the edited or final product.
The choice of what is and is not included is decided by the repo holder, who can approve or deny merges of text
in part or whole.

However, once that text has been approved, and merged, the recognition will be
given to the author by allowing the reader/user to interact with the e-text file to see who wrote
that bit of story.

As this idea continued, I began to realize that collaborative efforts are much more than just a series
of writers adding their ideas in text. There are also illustrators, voice actors, flow and content managers.
Why limit this to only a collaborative effort amongst text focused stories, why not
open this up to the realm of graphic novelists, maybe adding illustrations in a collaborative way.
Comic fans adding their ideas to the workings of a side arch idea for Marvel's Avengers or
DC's Sandman universe. Finally, beyond the realm of sight, we enter into a collaboration
that could occur between voice actors who want to add their ideas and skills as particular
characters in a audiobook rendering of a story. The list truly goes on. but, we get the idea.

To Start.

lets build a simple thing, that allows people to upload their story ideas and have a voting/ranking
arrow to allow patrons the gift of downvoting or upvotng someones hard work. We haven't quite worked out the 
emotional ramifications of said component. but, you can't have it all.


now! to add more context to the voting piece of the story profile. lets have a discussion
bar bellow where you can comment on the lovely bit of writing or , dare I say, arting.


each patron will need their own unique profile id. and that profile id can only vote
once per story, but can change their vote later on down the road as the story maybe progresses
and becomes a more cohesive piece of literary pros.
